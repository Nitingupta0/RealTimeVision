# Real-Time Computer Vision

This is a self-initiated project exploring real-time computer vision techniques using Python and OpenCV. It demonstrates how to capture, process, and analyze live video feeds for tasks such as face detection and object tracking.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades
- Object detection using contour analysis or color segmentation
- Live camera feed processing using OpenCV
- Frame-by-frame analysis and annotation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
